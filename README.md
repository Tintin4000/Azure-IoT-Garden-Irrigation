# Azure-IoT-Garden-Irrigation

BACKGROUND

Develop a multi-tier micro-controller (SoC) concept containing sensors, a sensor hub and controllers. The project challenges are the development of autonomous sensors with very low consumption, a hub capable of communicating with various sensors within medium range distance and feeding a cloud base architecture, as well as controllers that can be activated remotely by manual actions or through a machine learning service.

TECHNOLOGY

The choice of technology has been based on knowledge and experience, along with the project pre-requisites. The sensors, due to the low consumption nature of the project, are built around Arduino Pro Mini, the hub has been developed with ESP8266 for its Wi-Fi capability as well its 16-bit architecture and its large memory capacity. The controllers are construct around the Arduino MKR1000 for their large IO and Wi-Fi connectivity as well as its capability of handling battery redundancy.

SENSOR â€“ AIR & SOIL TEMPERATURE & HUMIDITY

The sensor is build around an Arduino Pro Mini equipped with an Atmel 368P 3.3V 8MHz and a 433MHz HC-12 Wireless transmitter along with a DHT22 temperature ad humidity sensor as well as an industrial soil sensor SENSIRION SHT20.
